# Unity BuiltIn CommandBuffer Examples

Examples contain:
- Basic Command Buffer flow implementation: construction / deconstruction
- Mesh Drawer
- PostProcessing

All scripts can be used independedntly. You can also notice, that all command buffer related scripts contain construction / deconstruction logic, this flow is recommended to achieve proper rendering without errors or dublication.

This is quite important to understand a general [Built-In Render Pipeline Flow](https://imgbb.com/BLSGdPQ), considering your rendering path.
